# CSharpTypeComparerTest
How fast can different data types in different list types be compared?

## What it does!
- Generating 100 objects with all common data types in c#
- Fill objects with randomized data
- Initialize common lists and fill these with the generated objects
- Run the test and compare all objects with the same data types and save the ellapsed time in miliseconds
  - In Mainthread
  - In Single Threaded Tasks
  - In Multithreaded Tasklist
- Write all results in a csv file (location: D:\)

## Why?
It shows which data type can perform with best results in comparing operations.
